    Description of command...
         -r   receptor_filename 
        supported file types include pdb,mol2,pdbq,pdbqs,pdbqt, possibly pqr,cif

    Optional parameters:"
        # [-v]  verbose output (default is minimal output)
        [-o pdbqt_filename]  (default is 'molecule_name.pdbqt')
        [-A]  type(s) of repairs to make: 
             'bonds_hydrogens': build bonds and add hydrogens
             'bonds': build a single bond from each atom with no bonds to its closest neighbor"
             'hydrogens': add hydrogens
             'checkhydrogens': add hydrogens only if there are none already
             'None': do not make any repairs 
             (default is 'None')
        [-C]  preserve all input charges ie do not add new charges 
             (default is addition of gasteiger charges)
        [-p]  preserve input charges on specific atom types, eg -p Zn -p Fe
        [-U]  cleanup type:
             'nphs': merge charges and remove non-polar hydrogens
             'lps': merge charges and remove lone pairs
             'waters': remove water residues
             'nonstdres': remove chains composed entirely of residues of
                      types other than the standard 20 amino acids
             'deleteAltB': remove XX@B atoms and rename XX@A atoms->XX
             (default is 'nphs_lps_waters_nonstdres') 
        [-e]  delete every nonstd residue from any chain
              'True': any residue whose name is not in this list:
                      ['CYS','ILE','SER','VAL','GLN','LYS','ASN', 
                      'PRO','THR','PHE','ALA','HIS','GLY','ASP', 
                      'LEU', 'ARG', 'TRP', 'GLU', 'TYR','MET', 
                      'HID', 'HSP', 'HIE', 'HIP', 'CYX', 'CSS']
              will be deleted from any chain. 
              NB: there are no  nucleic acid residue names at all 
              in the list and no metals. "
             (default is False which means not to do this)
        [-M]  interactive "
             (default is 'automatic': outputfile is written with no further user input)
        [-d dictionary_filename] file to contain receptor summary information
